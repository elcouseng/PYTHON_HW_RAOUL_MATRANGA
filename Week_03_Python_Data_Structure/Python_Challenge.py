1. Summation towards target
If I have a list of integers, I want to find the combination that sums up to a target value k.

Input -- 
    lst = [3,4,5,1,2], k = 9

Output -- 
    [1,2]

Explanation:
    lst[1] = 4
    lst[5] = 5
    lst[1] + lst[5] = 9 = k
"""

def 2Sum(lst, k):
    # write your code here;
    pass
